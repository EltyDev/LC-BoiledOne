  displayText: "The Boiled One, also called l'\xE9bouillant\xE9e or the Bouilli in
    French, is an entity discovered in the year 2493 on the moon Zyrix by C-E92 (Company
    Crew 92). The crew went to the old factory after receiving an SOS transmission.
    Zyrix is \u200B\u200Ban old moon abandoned by the Company in the year 2412 following
    a military incident. The moon was classified as forbidden and S++ due to abnormal
    levels of fine radioactive particles. During the exploration of the old factory,
    deactivated Coil-Heads are discovered as well as the lifeless bodies of C-E23.
    The bodies are charred and the heads of several bodies are missing. The C-E92
    report mentions a transmission disturbance with the ships, whispering and trumpet
    sound resonating in the walls. C-E92 stops transmitting definitively after 10
    hours of exploration, the last image transmissions show the body of the Boiled
    One, a humanoid that appears limbless and with a face twisted by raw flesh. The
    Boiled One is somehow invisible to the naked eye except when seen from inside
    a camera or by victims of his curse. He will try to convince him to kill himself,
    which caused the loss of C-E92.\r\n\r\nAccording to the investigation opened,
    the Boiled One would be Mr. DIRETUS leader of C-E23 reported missing shortly
    after the Zyrix incident.\r\n\r\nCompany note: In case of vision or sound associated
    with a trumpet, a charred humanoid form or unknown transmissions picked up in
    the walkie-talkies, it is advisable to evacuate the moon or let one of you perish
    to the Boiled One. \r"
